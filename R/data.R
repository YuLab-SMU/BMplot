#' Simulated arabidopsis thaliana BSseq object created by DSS
#'
#' A simulated data set contains methylation information.
#' These data were created by finding the adenine positions in a specific region,
#' which was supposed to be the dmR, and assign the adenine sites with random values.
#' At last created BSseq object by DSS.
